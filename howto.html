    <h1>How to Use Sorting Visualizer</h1>
    <p>Sorting Visualizer will visualize how sorting algorithm works. 
    Start visualize now by following these steps.</p>
    <h3>1. Sorting Preparation</h3>
    <p>Before start sorting, you can set how large the array of data and how fast the animation will be.
    You can also randomize the array values. You can skip this step if going with the default setting.</p>
    <h3>2. Start Sorting</h3>
    <p>You can start sorting by choosing one of the sorting algorithm desired to be used to sort the array. Once the sorting process is done you can randomize the array again and then start sorting again. If you want to start another sorting while sorting is in process, try to refresh the page first so it would not mess the algorithm.</p>
