    <h1>About Sorting Algorithm</h1>
    <p>In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order.</p>
    <p>Sorting Visualizer will visualize how sorting algorithm works. Sorting Visualizer provides sorting visualizations with 5 different sorting algorithm</p>
    <h3>1. Bubble Sort</h3>
    <p>Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.</p>
    <h3>2. Selection Sort</h3>
    <p>The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.</p>
    <h3>3. Insertion Sort</h3>
    <p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.</p>
    <h3>4. Merge Sort</h3>
    <p>Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.</p>
    <h3>5. Quick Sort</h3>
    <p>Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.</p>
